dxflib - CVSINFO


This file tells you how to check out source anonymously through pserver

Change into the directory where you want to create the dxflib directory tree

Type the following:

	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.dxflib.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dxflib login

If it asks you for a password, just type enter.

After anonymously logging in:

	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.dxflib.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dxflib co dxflib

After initial checkout, you can change into this directory and execute cvs commands 
without the -d tag. For example:

	cvs update
