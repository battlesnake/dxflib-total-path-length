dxflib - FAQ


Why another DXF library? Why not using DIME (www.sim.no/dime.html)?

	DIME is open-source but not available for free for commercial use. That's OK.
	However, DIME does NOT accept contributions to the project under GPL due to
	the fact that they want be able to sell the product. For an open-source 
	library this is IMHO unacceptable.


How can I contribute to dxflib?

	Please checkout the latest version via CVS and take a look at the code and
	the documentation. Contact the main developer (see AUTHORS) by e-mail to 
	contribute your changes or to get CVS write access.


Are there any example programs available which use dxflib?

	The only example program at the moment is vec2web. A format converter which
	converts DXF files to PNG, WBMP and PS or shows them in a X11 or Windows 
	window. 
	vec2web is available from its homepage at http://vec2web.sourceforge.net
	QCad II will also use dxflib. QCad II is under development however...
