Hi
==

I needed a command-line tool to calculate the total path length for DXF files
non-interactively, so I hacked the functionality into the demo that comes with
`dxflib`.  Run the demo with the `-l` option to calculate the total length.

	./test/test -l <DXF file>

What is dxflib ? 
================

2D DXF library
Simple to use
Written in C++
Tested under Linux

dxflib is an opensource C++ library for reading and writing (planned) 
AutoDesk (R) DXF files. It's at the moment very simple but already 
provides the functionality to read basic entities of a DXF file.
